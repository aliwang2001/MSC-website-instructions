# MSC website on GITHUB
The website is located here: [caltech-msc.github.io](https://caltech-msc.github.io)

The MSC website will now be hosted on GitHub. This will allow everyone to be able to collaborate and help make the website amazing for the public. A copy of all website files will be on a folder in the server, and someone familiar with GitHub will update the website every week or so.

# Important:

## Things you can do
* Add your contact card to the group page, optional info to display is picture, email, cell, or personal page (Scroll down)
* Add your own, personal page, with functions such as displaying a bio, a calendar with your schedule, anything. 
* Add your own collaborative group page, either hosted on the main website repository or on your own repository.
